# Pretrain wan workload on Ironwood GKE clusters with Kubernetes JobSet

This recipe outlines the steps for running a wan
[MaxDiffusion](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion) pretraining
workload on
[Ironwood GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
by applying a Kubernetes manifest to deploy a JobSet resource.

## Prerequisites

This recipe assumes the following prerequisites are met:

-   **GKE Cluster:** A GKE cluster with
    [JobSet](https://jobset.sigs.k8s.io/docs/installation/) installed and
    running.
-   **Container Image:** A pre-built container image (such as
    `gcr.io/my-project/my-maxdiffusion-runner:latest`) containing the
    MaxDiffusion workload, accessible by the GKE cluster.
-   **Tools:** `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`, and `envsubst`
    installed on your workstation. If `envsubst` is missing, install it with
    `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gettext-base`.
-   **Permissions:** You have permissions to run `kubectl apply` on the target
    cluster and the cluster has permissions to pull the container image.

## Orchestration and deployment tools

For this recipe, the following setup is used:

-   **Orchestration** -
    [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
-   **Pretraining job configuration and deployment** - A Kubernetes manifest
    (`k8s_manifest.yaml`) is used to define and deploy the
    [Kubernetes Jobset](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/23/introducing-jobset)
    resource, which manages the execution of the MaxDiffusion pretraining
    workload.

## Get the recipe
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ai-hypercomputer/tpu-recipes.git
cd tpu-recipes/training/ironwood/wan2.1-14b/bf16-tpu7x-4x4x4/k8s
```
## Run the recipe

This recipe uses a Kubernetes manifest (k8s_manifest.yaml) to deploy the
workload. The following commands will set the required environment variables,
substitute them into k8s_manifest.yaml, and apply the resulting configuration to
your cluster.

1.  Configure Environment Variables Open a terminal and set the following
    environment variables to match your setup.

**Note:**

-   `k8s_manifest.yaml` is in the same directory as this README.
- For `WORKLOAD_IMAGE` see [Docker container image](../xpk/README.md#docker-container-image) section.
- For `DATASET_DIR` see [Docker container image](../xpk/README.md#training-dataset) section.

```bash
# Set variables for your environment
export PROJECT_ID=""    # Your GCP project name
export CLUSTER_NAME=""  # The name of your GKE cluster
export ZONE=""          # The zone of your GKE cluster
export BASE_OUTPUT_DIR=""    # e.g., "gs://your-bucket-name/my-base-output-dir"
export WORKLOAD_IMAGE=""   # e.g., "gcr.io/my-project/my-maxdiffusion-runner:latest"
export DATASET_DIR="" # e.g., "gs://<YOUR_BUCKET>/PusaV1_training" from the previous step

# Set workload name (or modify as needed, make sure its unique in the cluster)
export WORKLOAD_NAME="$(printf "%.26s" "${USER//_/-}-wan")-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
```

1.  Run wan Pretraining Workload Once the environment variables are
    set, run the following commands to fetch cluster credentials and deploy the
    JobSet:

```bash
# Fetch cluster credentials
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_ID}

# Apply the manifest
envsubst '${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR} ${WORKLOAD_NAME} ${WORKLOAD_IMAGE} ${DATASET_DIR}' < k8s_manifest.yaml | kubectl apply -n default -f -
```

## Monitor the job

To monitor your job's progress, you can use kubectl to check the Jobset status
and logs:

You can also monitor your cluster and TPU usage through the Google Cloud
Console:
https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/workload/overview?project={PROJECT_ID}

```bash
# Check JobSet status
kubectl get jobset -n default ${WORKLOAD_NAME}

# Get the name of the first pod in the JobSet
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=${WORKLOAD_NAME} -n default -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Follow the logs of that pod
kubectl logs -f ${POD_NAME}
```

## Delete resources

Delete a specific workload To delete the JobSet created by this recipe, run:

```bash
kubectl delete jobset ${WORKLOAD_NAME} -n default
```

## Check results

After the job completes, you can check the results by:

Accessing output logs from your job using kubectl logs. Checking any data stored
in the Google Cloud Storage bucket specified by the ${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR} variable
in your run_recipe.sh. Reviewing metrics in Cloud Monitoring, if configured.
